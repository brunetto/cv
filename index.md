# Brunetto Marco Ziosi
## Me
                                        
Passionate developer and architect. PhD in Astrophysics. A present with Go, a past with Python, PHP and Fortran (and just a little taste of C and C++). Love data telling stories and the beauty of visual narration. Like simplicity, sharing and collaboration. Constantly improving, prompted by curiosity, triggered by problem solving. Traveler, geek and photographer in the spare time.

"Software engineering is what happens to programming when you add time and other programmers." [Russ Cox]

## About me
                                        
Passionate developer hanging out with Go at the moment, PhD in Astrophysics. A past with Python, PHP and Fortran (and just a little taste of C and C++). Love data telling stories and the beauty of visual narration. Like simplicity, sharing and collaboration. Constantly improving, prompted by curiosity, triggered by problem solving. 
Traveler, geek and photographer in the spare time.

"Software engineering is what happens to programming when you add time and other programmers." [Russ Cox]

## Work experience

**Senior Software Engineer @ Pixartprinting - a Cimpress company**

`Sep 2019 - Present`

Actively drive the company manufactury division through the trasformation from a "on-premise monolithic ERP" based company to a modern reality powered by distributed cloud-based software.
Define the architecture of the current and future manufacturing software as a whole, together with its interactions with the other actors such as BI or the production stakeholders.    
Create the common services that make up the foundation of the cloud manufacturing applications.
Curate the internal standards and best practices, provide tools and libraries for the common tasks enabling rapid and safe development of new applications.
Imagine, design and build entire new production lines from scratch, completely cloud-based, in matter of weeks.    
Reference for the up-to-date knowledge of the language of choice (Go) inside the company.

**Senior Software Engineer @ Pixartprinting - a Cimpress company**

`Jan 2018 - Sep 2019`

Design, build and ship Go micro-services on AWS (mainly Lambda, SNS, SQS, DynamoDB and S3, sometime ECS).
Help other teams porting legacy workflows to the AWS cloud.     
Provide support the PHP/AJAX/MySQL legacy ERP monolith while migrating to the new architecture.   
Focus on the logistic side of the business both developing solutions for the packaging and shipping management and integrating external services.    
Provide solutions for the integration of production machines (e.g. printers, industrial cutters, package sorters and palletizers) into the new cloud architecture.

**Software Developer @ Pixartprinting - a Cimpress company**

`Sep 2015 - Jan 2018`

Develop internal solutions for packaging and shipping management inside the PHP/AJAX/MySQL legacy ERP monolith.
Optimize and automate the external carriers and outsourcers integration.
Introduce the Go language into the company tech stack, design and build the first Go micro-services on AWS.   
                                    
**Research fellow @ INAF-OAPd**

`Jan 2015 - Jul 2015`

Study gravitational waves sources in young star clusters by means of direct N-body and stellar evolution simulations. Develop Go and Python code to set up, run and analyse simulations on several remote computing clusters. Modify C++ code to model different physical processes involved.

**Teaching assistant @ University of Padova**

`2012 - 2013`

Advise students with theory and exercises for the Python Lab and Mathematical analysis classes.

**Intern @ University of Padova**

`2010`

Technical characterization of the Asiago astrophysical observatory, 3D model using Blender.

## Education
**PhD, Astronomy and Astrophysics @ University of Padova**

`2012 - 2015`
 
Work on N-body simulations of star clusters to study the impact of stellar evolution and dynamics on neutron stars and black holes binary systems. These objects have been observed as sources of gravitational waves. Develop Go and Python code to set up, run and analyse simulations on several remote computing clusters.
                                   
**Master degree in Astronomy @ University of Padova**

`2007 - 2011`

Develop Python code to analyse the spatial statistical properties of dark matter halos in the largest cosmological simulations.
                                   
**Bachelor degree in Astronomy @ University of Padova**

`2004 - 2007`

Develop IDL code to simulate and analyze optical vortexes with different angular momentum. Compare the results with data obtained on the optical bench.

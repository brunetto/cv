# Brunetto Marco Ziosi
## Me
                                        
After years spent in science and technology, I shifted to photography to stay closer to human experiences. I work across social, cultural, and personal contexts — moments of intensity, quietness, celebration, and resistance — always guided by the relationship that forms in front of the camera.

My previous experience shapes how I work: with structure, care, and attention to people’s well-being, so that the focus can remain where it belongs — on people.
